            This exercise will require no code changes on your part. All 
            interactions will be through a REST client. You will use the REST
            client to move a simple banking application through a defined 
            state machine for opening the bank and managing an account.
        </para>
        <para>
            Instructions for using the REST client are written using the 
            Eclipse-based, JBoss Web Service Test Tool but other tools could
            be used in its place with the provided data.

        <title>Summary</title>
        <para>During this exercise you should have noticed that the only 
            things our client knew out-of-band was the representations and
            the meaning of the links. Our client did not know any URIs 
            beyond the root URI to bootsrap the process. All URIs were 
            provided at runtime as hrefs. Thus our application was 
            hyperlink-driven or designed with Hyperlinks As The Engine Of
            Application State (HATEAOS) -- which is the final and core
            concept in REST beyond what is present in Level 2 HTTP Web Services.</para>
